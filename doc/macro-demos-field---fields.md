Scripting Geometry Nodes
-----------------------------------------------------

module : demos/fields
---------------------
Builds Geometry Nodes to generate fields. Fields can be visualized with Arrows.

Two types of trees are built:
    - Field computation : groups which compute the field vectors at given locations
    - Field visualization : modifiers which visualizes the previus field

Electromagnetic fields
----------------------

The computing groups computes E and B fields from parameters.
The modifiers use the groups to visualize one of the two fields

- G X Moving Charge Field / X Moving Charge Field : a single charge moving along X axis
- G Moving Charge Field / Moving Charge Field : a single charge moving in an arbitraty direction
- G Charges on Curve Field / Charges on Curve Fielf : several charges moving along a curve
- G XY Loop Radial Field : the radial field generated by a single solenoid loop
- G XY Loop Field : the field generated by a single solenoid loop
- G Solenoid Field / Solenoid Field : the field generated by a solenoid
- G Electric Field / Electric Field : electric field generated by charges

Utilities
---------
- Compute Lines of Field : compute field lines from a field computation. The field group uses position as socket input.
  the output socket E or B is used as input of the group 'G Field Lines'
