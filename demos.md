# Demos

***geonodes*** comes with a set of demo files.

## Tutorials

### Hello World

[Hello Word](doc/helloworld.md) : a simple demo to start

### Arrows

[Arrows](doc/arrows.md) : create an arrow with cartesian, polar or spherical coordinates. Or a field of arrows.

### Curly

[Curly](doc/curly.md) : playing with curves topology

### Explosition

[Explosion](doc/explosion.md) : a sphere explodes and pieces are projected and fall with gravity

### Forest

[Forest](doc/forest.md) : generating a simple forest

### Gravity

[Gravity](doc/gravity.md): Newton law simulated on a bunch of planets

### Rain

[Rain](doc/rain.md): simulation of dips falling on a terrain with puddles. Dips on the puddles generate waves,
when dips on the terrain produce projections.

### Topology

[Topology](doc/topology.md): after a discussion  with @pterusgithub, here are modifier to explore domain indices


## Utilities

Some modifiers can be used in production

### Counters

[Counters & clocks](doc/counters.md) to build digital or analogic counters, including a digital clock.

### Fields

[Fields](doc/fields.md) comes with modifiers to compute and visualize electromagnetic fields. The base
components I used in my videos on electromagnetism.


### 4D Engine

[4D Engine](doc/fourd.md) the 4D engine I used in my videos on 4D

### Fractal

[Fractal and more](doc/fractal.md): to play with fractals but not only. Also comes with a comprhensive camera culling
a gaussian random generator and a multires surface modifier.
