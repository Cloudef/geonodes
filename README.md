![Scripting Geometry Nodes for Blender](doc/images/geonodes.png)

## Short

**Geometry Nodes** is a powerful **Blender** feature allowing the creation of amazing 3D models.
However, nodes trees can rapidly look like a _spaghetti plate_ difficult to understand and to maintain.
Complex formulas are not easy to build and debugging can be a headache.<br>

> The purpose of **_geonodes_** is to to create geometry nodes with python scripts.<br>

You keep the full power of Blender _Geometry Nodes_ but with the elegance of Python.

## Better a demo than long words

The following script creates a surface from a grid by computing
`z = sin(d)/d` where `d=sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` is the distance of the vertex to the center.

```python
from geonodes import *

# Create the Geometry nodes named "Hello World"

with GeoNodes("Hello World"):

    # The surface is basically a grid 20 x 20 with a resolution 200 x 200
    grid = Mesh.Grid(vertices_x=200, vertices_y=200, size_x=20, size_y=20)

    # z is computed using gnmath library and operators as in pure python
    with Layout("Computing the wave"):
        pos = nd.position
        distance = gnmath.sqrt(pos.x**2 + pos.y**2)
        z = height*gnmath.sin(distance*omega)/distance

    # Let's change the z coordinate of our vertices
    with Layout("Point offset and smoothness"):
        grid.points.offset = (0, 0, z)
        grid.faces.smooth = True

    # We are done: plugging the deformed grid as the modified geometry
    grid.out()
```

## Installation

**geonodes** is a python package. To install it, copy the package folder **geonodes** in `scripts/modules`.

The Blender `scripts` folder is defined in Blender preferences, see: [Blender File Paths settings](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/file_paths.html).

> Note that **geonodes** is a python module, not an Blender addon

After the install, the Blender scripts hierarchy should look like:
```
.../scripts/
       modules/
           geonodes/
               __init__.py
               geonodes
               shadernodes
               demos
               ...
```

To make the module available in your script, use `import` in your script:

```python
from geonodes import *
```

or

``` python
from geonodes import GeoNodes, ShaderNodes, Geometry, Mesh, Vector...
```

## Documentation

Uses [index](docs/index.md) to gain access to the list of availables classes.

## Scripting nodes overview

All nodes belong to a tree. Two tree types are available:
- `GeoNodes` : [Geometry Nodes](docs/GeoNodes/GeoNodesTree.md)
- `ShaderNodes` : [Shader Nodes](docs/Shader/ShaderTree.md)

# Basics

## Prerequisites

To get the maximum benefit of **GeoNodes**, you must be familiar with both **python** and Blender **Geometry Nodes**.

### Blender Setup

Create a new script in _Scripting_ tab in **Blender**. You can setup this tab in order to display:

- A _Text editor_ for python scripting
- A _3D Viewport_ to view the progress
- A _Python Console_ to dump variables
- A _Geometry Node Editor_ to view the generated nodes

Here after is an example of the recommanded setup:

<img src="doc/images/blender_setup.png" width="600" class="center">

### 'Do Nothing' Modifier

Copy / paste the following piece of code to check that everything is properly setup:

``` python
from geonodes import *

with GeoNodes("Do Nothing"):
    Geometry().out()
```

A Geometry Nodes modifier has been created with the name "Do Nothing". You can use it on any object.

> [!NOTE]
> All scripts are supposed to start with ``` from geonodes import * ```.
> Then, nodes must be created only in the sccope of **with** context.

All the code samples must be placed after the following lines:

``` python
from geonodes import *

with GeoNodes("Tutorial"):
    pass
```

## Modules and Classes

### 'gnmath' module

**gnmath** provides the mathematical functions, basically the operations performed by
_Math_, _Vector Math_ and _Boolean Math_ nodes.

Math functions are named after their standard name in python **math** module.

> [!NOTE]
> **Vector** functions having the same name as their **Float** equivalent are prefixed with the letter *v*

``` python
a = Float(1)
b = gnmath.sin(a)
c = gnmath.multiply_add(10, b)

u = Vector((1, 2, 3))
v = gnmath.cross_product(u, (7, 8, 9))
a = gnmath.vsin(v)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Similarly **Boolean** functions _and_, _or_ and _not_ are prefixed by the letter *b*

``` python
a = Boolean(True)
b = gnmath.xor(a, False)
c = gnmath.band(b, False)
```

### 'nd' Class

**nd** (shortcut for **nodes**) exposes all the nodes as class methods.
This class is particuliarly usefull for input nodes such as _Position_ or _Radius_:

``` python
cube = Mesh.Cube() # or nd.cube()
new_pos = nd.position + (1, 2, 3)
cube = cube.set_position(new_pos)
```

### Data Classes

Each **Geometry Nodes** socket type is wrapped in a dedicated class. The available classes are the following:

- **Basic types**
  - Boolean, Integer, Float, Vector, Color, Rotation, Matrix, String
- **Blender Resources**
  - Material, Object, Texture, Collection, Image
- **Geometry**
  - Geometry
  - Geometry subclasses : Mesh, Curve, Cloud, Instances, Volume

  Blender **Nodes** are implemented as methods, properties and operators working on these classes.
  For instance, if `a` and `b` are two **Floats**, the script `a + b` will generate a **Math** node with
  operation _ADD_. The result of this operation is the **Output Socket** of the node.

### Domains

Geometry classes have one or several _Domain_ attributes according  **Blender** data structure.
The domains are the following:
- **Mesh**
  - points
  - faces
  - edges
  - corners
- **Curve**
  - points
  - splines
- **Cloud**
  - points
- **Instances**
  - insts
- **Volume**

The _Domain_ attribute is used in the nodes needing a _Domain_ parameter. In the following example,
the node '_Store Named Attribute_' is setup with the domain calling the method:

``` python
      # Create a Cube
      mesh = Mesh.Cube()

      # Store on domain POINT
      mesh.points.store_named_attribute("Point Value", 0.)

      # Store on domain FACE
      mesh.faces.store_named_attribute("Face Value", 0.)
```

> [!NOTE]
> A **Domain** is never instanced directly, it is always initialized as a property of a Geometry Class.

### Operators

Python operators can be used to operate on data, for instance:

``` python
# Float operators
a = Float(10)
c = a*pi # Math node, operation 'MULTIPLY'
c += 1 # Math node, operation 'ADD'
ok = a <=c # Compare node, operation 'LESS_EQUAL'

# Vector operators
u = Vector((1, 2, 3))
v = u + (7, 8, 9) # Vector Math node, operation 'ADD'
w = u*3 # Vector Math node, operation 'SCALE'

# Boolean operators
b = Boolean(True)
c = b | False # Boolean Math node, operation 'OR'

# String operators
s = String("A string")
s += ": this is something added. "
s += String(" ") * ("This", "is", "a", String("sentence."))

# Join Geometry
geo = Geometry() # Input geometry
geo += Mesh.Cube(), Curve.Spiral() # Join with two other geometries
```

> [!NOTE]
> Python _bool_ operators _or_, _and_ and _not_ don't apply on **Boolean** class, use their binary
> equivalent instead : |, & and -.

## Naming Conventions

### Node names

Naming conventions are such that method names can be easily deduced from the node name.

1. Method names are built from the name of the node using the _snake_case_ convention:
  - _Set Material_ : **set_material**
  - _Store Named Attribute_ : **store_named_attribute**
2. When the node creates a new instance of the socket, it is implemeted as a constructor **class method**
  using _CamelCase_ convention:
  - _Cube_ : constructor class method **Cube** of **Mesh**
  - _Combine XYZ_ : constructor class method **Combine** of **Vector**
  - _BÃ©zier Segment_ : constructor class method **BezierSegment** of **Curve**
3. The name of the socket data type is omitted when redundant:
  - _Curve to Mesh_ : **Curve.to_mesh** method
  - _Mesh to Points_ : **Mesh.to_points** method
  - _Curve to Points_ : **Curve.to_points** method
  - _Volume to Points_ : **Volume.to_points** method
  - _Mesh Line_ : **Mesh.Line** constructor
  - _Curve Line_ : **Curve.Line** constructor
4. _Set xxx_ are implemented as properties when possible:
  - _Set Position_ : **position** and **offset** properties of domain :
    ``` mesh.points.position = v ``` and ``` mesh.points.offset = v ```
  - _Set Radius_ : **radius** property of **Cloud.points** and **Curve.points** :
    ``` cloud.points.radius = v ``` and ``` curve.points.radius = v ```
  - _Set Tilt_ : **tilt** property of **Curve.points** : ``` curve.points.tilt = v ```
  - _Set Handle Type_ : **handle_type** property of **Curve.points** :
    ``` curve.points.handle_type = 'FREE' ```

The example below applies this set fo rules:

``` python
```



5. _Socket names_ can be accessed as properties of their node using the _snake_case_ convention:
  - _Value_ socket : **node.value**
  - _Geometry_ socket : **node.geometry**
6. When a socket is **set**, it is an ***Input socket*** of the node, when a socket is **get**,
  it is and ***Output socket*** of the node, for instance if `node` is _Resample Curve_:
  - `node.geometry = a` : set the ***Input socket*** _Geometry_ to the given value `a`
  - `b = node.geometry` : get the ***Ouput socket*** _Geometry_ and set the value `b`
  - `node.selection = c` : set the ***Input socket*** _Selection_ to the given value `c`
  - `e = node.selection` : raises an error since there is no ***Ouput socket*** named _Selection_

### Methods arguments



### Geometry or Domains methods

Blender _Geometry Nodes_ exposes one single _Geometry_ type. **GeoNodes** provides
one class per geometry type : **Mesh**, **Curve**, **Cloud**, **Instances**, **Volume** which are
subclasses of the generic **Geometry** class.

Nodes are implemented on their geometry classes:
- _Interpolate Curves_, _Resample Curve_, _Reverse Curve_ : implemented only on **Curve** class
- _Extrude Mesh_, _Flip Faces_, _Mesh Boolean_ : implemented only on **Mesh** class

Nodes needing a _Domain_ parameter are implemented on **Domain**, not **Geometry** :
- _Store Named Attribute_ : implemented on all domains
- _Extrude Mesh_ : implemented on **Mesh.points**, **Mesh.edges** and **Mesh.faces**

### Selection Socket
